**Introduction**

[Adderall](https://github.com/aleeusgr/potential-robot) is the latest release of potential-robot, a lightweight template for Cardano smart contracts written in Helios. 

**Project Overview**

Adderall is designed to simplify onboarding and reduce TTP (Time to Production) for developers working with Cardano smart contracts. It provides an easy-to-use framework for writing and testing smart contracts in Helios. The project includes a comprehensive suite of tests demonstrating how transactions are constructed, how to use the Helios library, and how to write tests using Vitest. It provides development environment setup that allows the user to start experimenting with Cardano smart contracts in under 3 minutes.

**What is the value of this project?**

- it reduces the time to production for Cardano smart contracts. eUTXO model is complex in itself and this project minimizes the number of tools user needs to learn to get started.
- Using Helios allows Typescript developers to write Cardano smart contracts in a familiar language, making it easier to onboard new developers.
- Test-driven development (TDD) is a not common practice in Typescript development, but it is essential for Cardano smart contracts. This project demonstrates how to develop smart contracts using TDD principles, ensuring that contracts are reliable and maintainable.

**Getting Started**

Proceed with the link above to the [repository](https://github.com/aleeusgr/potential-robot). The repository includes detailed instructions on how to set up the project, run tests, and deploy contracts.

**Special Thanks**

We would like to extend our gratitude to the Helios team, James Dunseith (Gimbalabs), Ben Hart (MLabs), Romain Soulat (IOG), and Matthias Sieber (EMURGO) for their inspiration and support. The project is also inspired by Nine Inch Nails, the SBF trial, and the show Inside Job.
