**Call for Volunteers: Help Shape the Future of Open Source Development**

Are you passionate about Open Source development and community building? We're excited to invite two volunteers to join our Developer Experience working group to help test and refine the Contribution Ladder, a developer thriving framework developed by the Open Source Office at Intersect, a member-based organization on Cardano.

**What is the Contribution Ladder?**
The Contribution Ladder is a framework that describes how developers progress through major milestones of their career in Open Source development, highlighting their goals, challenges, values, and motivations.

**How can you get involved?**
As a volunteer, you'll join our Developer Experience working group meetings to:

* Discuss the Contribution Ladder and its relevance to your own career journey
* Share your experiences and challenges as a developer in Open Source development
* Help us refine the framework to better support developer thriving and growth

By participating, you'll have the opportunity to:

* Shape the future of Open Source development on Cardano
* Connect with like-minded professionals and industry experts
* Gain insights into the latest developments in Open Source community building

**We're looking for:**
Two volunteers who are:

* Passionate about Open Source development and community building
* Willing to share their experiences and provide feedback on the Contribution Ladder
* Able to commit to regular working group meetings (frequency and duration to be determined)

**If you're interested, send us a message!** Let's work together to create a thriving community of developers on Cardano!
