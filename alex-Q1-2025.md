Jan 11th.

The New Year holiday passed in growth, healing and introspection. Being a Cardano Contributor turned out to be even more valuable beyond what I imagined, in particular due to harmony between culture at Intersect and my wolrdview and lifestyle. There are some lessons I have to learn. 

I am secure in the way that the right problems start to find me at this point in time: earlier partnership with Brytr grew through a coalition with digital-boss.de . Two founders and their teams onboarded and are working on a shared project - a Renewable Energy Certificate market. See discussion [here](https://youtu.be/fqLYD36LTs8?si=cuX9EPqpGiB81dr1) and [here](https://youtu.be/XmIHjNRht3I?si=eVjo8oNg5d1KHbwU)

- The Contribution Ladder recieved feedback: "who is the document intended to?" and "what are the actionable steps?";  

Next steps: 

- There are multiple opportunities here on site, it makes sense to investigate them till mid February - plan events with the local community and follow through with resolutions if any. 
- Developer Thriving Framework
- Brytr
- chasing rats and obtaining a secure wallet.
- F14
- devex repo
