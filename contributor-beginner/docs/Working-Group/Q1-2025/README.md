# Developer Experience Working Group (Q1: Oct–Dec 2025)

## Purpose & Why

The Developer Experience (DevEx) Working Group exists to onboard, support, and empower developers and contributors in the Cardano ecosystem. For Q1 (Oct–Dec 2025), our focus is on creating a clear entry path for newcomers, addressing common beginner barriers, and inspiring participation through real stories and practical skill-building. In the process we are looking to document every bit of how to join Cardano in general.

This quarter lays the foundation for long-term engagement by ensuring that every participant:

- **Understands where to find resources** (repos, docs, tooling, support)
- **Gains confidence with practical hands-on experience**
- **Sees clear pathways to contribute**, both as developers and non-developers
- **Feels part of a supportive, global community** aligned around 2026 goals

## Quarter Goals

1. **Onboard New Developers** – Provide clarity on repos, docs, tools, and support channels
2. **Practical Skill Development** – Through beginner and intermediate workshops (environment setup, token creation, wallet integration)
3. **Highlight Contribution/Builder Paths** – Showcase developer and community builder stories
4. **Support and Troubleshoot** – Open clinics to resolve common blockers and share solutions
5. **Documentation & Open Source Awareness** – Teach newcomers how to contribute to repos, docs, and community resources
6. **Community Alignment** – Reflect on 2025 achievements and build momentum for 2026
