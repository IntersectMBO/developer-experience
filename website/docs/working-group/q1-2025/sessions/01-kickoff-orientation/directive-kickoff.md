# Directive: Kickoff & Orientation

Welcome to the Cardano ecosystem! This guide provides a comprehensive map of where to find essential resources, repositories, documentation, tooling, and support channels to help you navigate and contribute effectively.

## → About Cardano

**Cardano** is a third-generation, proof-of-stake blockchain platform designed for sustainability, scalability, and transparency. Built on peer-reviewed research and evidence-based development, Cardano aims to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and financial systems.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Research-Driven**: Every protocol feature undergoes formal specification and peer review
- **Multi-Layered Architecture**: Separates settlement (ADA transactions) from computation (smart contracts)
- **Sustainable**: Energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus protocol
- **Interoperable**: Designed to work with other blockchains and legacy systems

## → About Intersect

**Intersect** is a member-based organization that serves as the governance and administrative body for Cardano. It facilitates community collaboration, coordinates development efforts, and ensures the long-term sustainability of the Cardano ecosystem.

**Mission**: To empower the Cardano community through transparent governance, coordinated development, and accessible resources for all participants—from beginners to core contributors.

**Key Functions:**

- Facilitating on-chain governance processes
- Coordinating technical working groups and committees
- Managing community resources and development programs
- Supporting developer experience and contributor onboarding

**Why Join as a Developer?** As an Intersect member, you get voting rights on ecosystem decisions, can participate in technical steering committees, access exclusive development updates, and help shape the tools and protocols you build with daily. Individual membership is just $10/year for full governance participation.
