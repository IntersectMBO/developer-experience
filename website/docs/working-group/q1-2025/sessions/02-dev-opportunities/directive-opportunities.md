# Opportunities in Cardano (2025)

## Welcome

We're the **Developer Experience Working Group** - a community of Developer Advocates from Intersect who make building on Cardano accessible and rewarding for everyone.

**Who We Are:** Part of Intersect MBO's Open Source Office, we bridge core Cardano development and the global community of builders and contributors.


**What We Do:**
We're here to remove barriers. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer, we help you find your way into the Cardano ecosystem by improving documentation, creating learning paths, gathering your feedback, and building a supportive community.

**Why This Session Matters:**
You're joining us at an exciting time. We're documenting every pathway into Cardano - for developers AND non-developers - so that anyone with an idea, skill, or passion can contribute and thrive.

**Today's Goals:**
- Introduce Cardano and what makes it unique
- Show opportunities available (technical and non-technical)
- Help you understand how to get started
- Answer your questions and gather feedback

**Our Commitment:** By the end, you'll know exactly where to go next. No question is too basic, and everyone here started somewhere.



## What is Cardano?

Cardano is a decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain platform known for its academic and research-driven approach to development. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2015 and launched in 2017, its goal is to be a more scalable, secure, and sustainable alternative to other blockchain networks. Its native cryptocurrency is ADA.

Cardano is a blockchain platform where you can build applications that no single company or government controls. Think financial apps without banks, digital ownership systems, voting platforms, and more - all running on a decentralized network.


### Key Features:

**Research-Driven Development**
The project emphasizes peer-reviewed research and formal development methods, involving top cryptographers and engineers. Every protocol feature undergoes academic peer review before implementation - like publishing scientific papers before building. This means fewer bugs, better security, and features designed to last decades.

**Sustainable by Design (Proof-of-Stake Consensus)**
Cardano uses a unique PoS algorithm called Ouroboros, which selects validators based on the amount of ADA they have staked. This makes it 99.9% more energy-efficient and scalable compared to proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin. Instead of burning electricity to mine blocks, participants stake ADA to secure the network and earn rewards.

**Layered Architecture**
The blockchain is separated into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL) for transactions and the Cardano Computation Layer (CCL) for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This allows for more flexible and efficient processing - each layer can be upgraded independently without affecting the other.

**Smart Contracts & Developer Tools**
In 2021, Cardano added smart contract functionality, enabling developers to build dApps on its network. Unlike many blockchains locked to one language, Cardano supports multiple programming languages:
- **Plutus** (Haskell-based) - Powerful and expressive

- **Aiken** - Modern and developer-friendly
- **Marlowe** - Specialized for financial contracts
- **OpShin** - Python-based for accessibility
- **Helios** - JavaScript-based for web developers

**Decentralized Governance**
ADA holders can vote on proposals for protocol upgrades and fund new projects through a decentralized treasury (Project Catalyst), ensuring the network's future is community-driven. No CEO decides Cardano's future - the community shapes the roadmap through on-chain governance.

**Scaling Solutions**
Cardano has implemented or is working on scaling solutions like Hydra (Layer-2 scaling) to increase transaction speeds and lower costs. These solutions allow the network to handle thousands of transactions per second while maintaining security and decentralization.

### What People Are Building?

**Financial Systems (DeFi):**
Lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins - all without traditional banks or intermediaries.

**Digital Ownership (NFTs):**
Art marketplaces, collectibles, gaming assets you actually own and can transfer freely.

**Identity & Credentials:**
Educational certificates, professional credentials, digital IDs you control - not stored in company databases.

**Supply Chain & Verification:**
Track products from farm to table, verify authenticity of goods, ensure ethical sourcing.

**Governance & Voting:**
Transparent voting systems, DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), community decision-making platforms.

**Gaming & Metaverse:**
Games where you own your items, virtual worlds with real economic systems.

**Why Developers Choose Cardano:**

- **Strong Foundation** - Built to last with academic rigor

- **Funding Available** - Project Catalyst provides grants from $15k to $200k+
- **Supportive Community** - Active forums, working groups, and mentorship
- **Multiple Languages** - Build with tools you already know
- **Environmental Responsibility** - Build guilt-free with minimal energy use
- **True Decentralization** - No company can shut down your project
- **Long-term Vision** - Focus on sustainability over hype

## About Intersect MBO

Intersect MBO is a member-based organization (MBO) for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem, dedicated to ensuring its continuity, maintenance, and decentralized future development. It serves as a central hub where community members, developers, and organizations collaborate to guide the project's strategic direction and governance. 

### Key Functions:
- **Facilitating Governance:** Intersect is a core institution in implementing Cardano's community-led governance model (known as the Voltaire era and specified by CIP-1694). It provides the off-chain structure and tooling (like GovTool) that enables on-chain voting and decision-making by ADA holders and their delegates (DReps).

- **Coordinating Development:** The organization orchestrates the delivery of the community-approved Cardano Technical Roadmap. A key part of this is to facilitate working groups and committees (e.g., Technical Steering, Budget, Civics) which assign specific tasks, discuss proposals, and coordinate open-source development of core technologies.

- **Managing the Treasury:** Intersect plays a crucial administrative role in managing the Cardano treasury funds. It implements policies for transparency, accountability, and the disbursement of funds for community-approved projects, using a mix of traditional contracts and smart contracts, often guided by recommendations from its budget committees.

- **Community Engagement:** It supports the community by hosting events, hackathons, and town halls to foster collaboration and local engagement through regional hubs. These platforms are used to solicit input that feeds into the working groups and governance processes.

- **Providing a Neutral Ground:** Intersect was created to shift the responsibility for the network's future away from the initial founding entities (IOG, Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo). It acts as a decentralized, community-driven "town square" where the working groups, committees, and general membership can safely deliberate and guide the project's direction. 


### Membership: 
Membership in Intersect is open to individuals and institutions, with both free and paid tiers offering different levels of participation, including the ability to join working groups, committees, and vote on important decisions. The organization is run by a governing board and an executive team, with elected members from the community. 

**Free Membership:** [intersectmbo.org](https://intersectmbo.org)
