# Opportunities in Cardano (2025)

## Welcome

We're the **Developer Experience Working Group** - a community of Developer Advocates from Intersect who make building on Cardano accessible and rewarding for everyone.

**Why This Session Matters:**
You're joining us at an exciting time. We're documenting every pathway into Cardano - for developers AND non-developers - so that anyone with an idea, skill, or passion can contribute and thrive.

**Today's Goals:**

- Overview
- Show opportunities available within the cardano ecosystem (technical and non-technical)
- Help you understand how to get started
- Answer your questions and gather feedback

**Our Commitment:** By the end, you'll know exactly where to go next. No question is too basic, and everyone here started somewhere.

## Overview

In the last session, we discussed about cardano, Intersect, and how to get started on Cardano. In this session, we will highlight the different opportunities that exist within the cardano ecosystem and how you can take advantage of them.

## Pathways to becoming a contributor

Cardano offers diverse pathways for participation, whether you code or not, there's a meaningful way for you to contribute and build a sustainable career. You can get started by following either of these two paths:

**Technical Contributions:**
Build the protocol, create applications, develop tools, test and secure the network, write technical documentation.

**Non-Technical Contributions:**
Build communities, lead initiatives and manage open source projects.

**You can start at any level and grow from there.**
