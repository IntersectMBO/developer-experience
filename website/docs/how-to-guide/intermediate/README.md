# Intermediate Guides

Welcome to the Intermediate Guides section! These guides are designed for developers who have mastered the basics and are ready to build more complex applications on Cardano.

## Coming Soon

### Smart Contract Development
- **Introduction to Plutus** - See [Plutus Pioneer Program](https://plutuspbl.io/) for comprehensive coverage
- **Getting started with Helios** - [TypeScript-based smart contract development](https://helios-lang.io/) (Recommended: 80% of developers globally use TypeScript; Midnight also uses TypeScript)
- **Getting started with Aiken** - Modern Rust-based smart contract language
- **Building your first smart contract**
- **Testing smart contracts** - Including QuickCheck methodology for property-based testing

### Native Token Development

- Using Cardano APIs effectively
- Debugging Cardano applications
- Performance optimization

## Prerequisites

Before starting these guides, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic Cardano concepts (addresses, transactions, UTXOs)
- Command-line tools (cardano-cli)
- Programming fundamentals
- Familiarity with [docs.cardano.org](https://docs.cardano.org) and [developers.cardano.org](https://developers.cardano.org)
- Completed at least 2-3 [Beginner Guides](../beginner/README.md)
