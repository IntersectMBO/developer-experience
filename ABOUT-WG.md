# Purpose
This is a community-driven group led by a team of developer advocates that is dedicated to:
* Identifying and presenting potential solutions to developer experience problems that span the Cardano ecosystem. 
* Once a potential solution is identified, we work with actors in the ecosystem to find sponsorship to implement a solution. 

The aim is to identify and develop strategies to improve the overall developer experience across the cardano ecosystem. Specifically targeting developers working against Cardano Layer 1.
