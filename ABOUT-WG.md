# Purpose
This is a community-driven group dedicated to identifying and presenting potential solutions to developer experience problems that span the Cardano ecosystem. Once a potential solution is identified, we work with actors in the ecosystem to find sponsorship to implement a solution. 
The aim is to identify and develop strategies to improve the overall developer experience across the cardano ecosystem. Specifically targeting developers working against Cardano Layer 1.
